# ImgFlip
A small library to make memes using the API from imgflip.com

This is a very simple example of making REST queries to interact with a webservice. More of a skill-builder project than anything that will ever be useful.

You are free to use the code / built library in any way you wish as long as I don't get in trouble for it.
